# Panoramic-Image-using-SIFT
Creating a Panoramic image from 2 images using SIFT, and wrap
1.  Creating SIFT images to find the key points of the 2 images. 
2.  Then perform Homography which relates the transformation between two plane by using RANSAC Algorithm
3.  KNN matching is then applied to find the similar points in the two images.
4.  We then warp the 2 images to get the panoramic image
